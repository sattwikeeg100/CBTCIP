<h2>Spam Email Detection</h2>

The TASK-4 of this internship is to build a Machine Learning Model on Spam Email Detection âœ‰ . 

We've all been the recipients of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or phishing content. In this Project, I have used Python to build an email spam detector and then, used machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
