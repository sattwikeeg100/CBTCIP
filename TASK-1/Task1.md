<h2>Iris Flower Classification</h2>

The TASK-1 of this internship is to build a Machine Learning Model on Iris Flower ClassificationðŸŒº. 

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assuming that we have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, this machine-learning model can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
